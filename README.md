Hand gesture recognition is a crucial component of human-computer interaction, providing a natural way for users to communicate with machines. This project aims to build a state-of-the-art deep learning model capable of recognizing different hand gestures in real-time, making it suitable for applications like sign language interpretation, virtual reality interfaces, gaming, and smart home controls.
